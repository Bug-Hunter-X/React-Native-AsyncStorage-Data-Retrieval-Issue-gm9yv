# React Native AsyncStorage Data Retrieval Issue

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native's AsyncStorage when retrieving data after the app has been closed and reopened. The issue stems from the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage and how it interacts with the app's lifecycle.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where data is stored in AsyncStorage. When the app is closed and reopened, the retrieved data is sometimes incorrect or null, leading to unexpected behavior in the app. This is because the asynchronous operation of retrieving data may not complete before the app component mounts after it is closed and reopened.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using promises and error handling to ensure reliable data retrieval. The solution uses the `getItem` method with proper error handling and ensures the data is successfully retrieved before the app uses it.  This approach solves the asynchronous nature of the AsyncStorage.
